        <div class="box" id="readme" style="display: none;">Pong Hau K'i is a Chinese traditional board game
            for two players.<br> The board consists of 5 vertices and 7 edges. Each player has two pieces.
            Players take turns to move. At each turn, the player moves one of his two pieces into the adjacent
            vacant vertex. If a player can't move, he loses.<br>
            Only one type of position can make a player lose. If both players play perfectly,
            the game continues endlessly with no winner.</div>
